# Monte-Carlo AI
This project aims to produce and AI that, given the rules of a game, can learn to play it at a superhuman level. This work is based on Deepmind's AlphaZero AI however all software is self-written.

Current state:
A monte-carlo tree search algorithm has been implemented
Perfect play has been achieved in Connect4 and Tic Tac Toe.

Todo:
Efficiently implement Draughts
Implement a Neural Network for value scoring
